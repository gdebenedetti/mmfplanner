MMF Planner
===========

MMF Planner is a project planning tool for projects using the Incremental
Funding Method (IFM).

IFM integrates traditional software engineering activities with financially
informed project management strategies. IFM heuristics provide clarity into
important metrics such as project level Net Present Value (NPV), Return On
Investment (ROI), initial start-up investment costs, and time needed for a
project to reach self-funding and break-even.

An IFM project consists of Minimal Marketable Features (MMFs). A MMF has
quantifiable value to the customer. Each MMF has economical figures according
to the estimated investment and earnings. A MMF can also have a precursor which
is a feature that has to be implemented before the actual MMF.


Project history
---------------

MMF Planner started as an idea at Iterate AS. It was given as an assignment to
the five students Snorre Gylterud, Stein Magnus Jodal, Johannes Knutsen, Erik
Bagge Ottesen, and Ralf Bjarne Taraldset as a part of the Customer Driven
Project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in the autumn of
2007.
