Version 1.0.1 - Released 2007 November 21

  Enhancements:

    - Renamed swimlane sort to pretty sort.

    - NPV chart: In cases with multiple minimas, the self-funding point was set
      at the first minima, instead of the global minima.

  Bugfixes:

    - File open did not work because the XML parser tried to reach the XML DTD,
      which was specified as an URI in saved projects, at the local computer.
      Fixed by not adding the DTD URI in saved projects.
